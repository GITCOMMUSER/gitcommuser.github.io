  <p>
  Void Linux is a very minimal distribution. It allows you to manually
  configure almost everything. Its init system is Runit, which is fast and simple to use.
  Void isn’t bloated with software, so it’s a great choice for minimalist users.
  It’s a rolling release distribution, which means some packages are always up
  to date — this can sometimes introduce risks of system instability.
  But if we compare Void Linux’s package manager to Arch Linux, Void 
  is generally more stable. That’s because Void has fewer packages, 
  so there’s a lower chance of encountering buggy ones.
  This is the start of my Void Linux journey. Everything
  I learn, I’ll share here — as much as possible.
  My name is Mohammad Amini, and I’ve been a Linux user for three years.
